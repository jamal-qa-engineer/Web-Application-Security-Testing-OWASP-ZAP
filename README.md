# Web-Application-Security-Testing-OWASP-ZAP

# Objective
This project focuses on mastering web application security testing using OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), one of the most popular open-source web application security scanners. The primary objective is to develop practical skills in identifying, analyzing, and exploiting common web application vulnerabilities through automated scanning, manual testing, and API security assessment. By completing this module, I gained hands-on experience with intercepting HTTP/HTTPS traffic, performing both passive and active security scans, and understanding how to leverage ZAP's extensive toolset for comprehensive web application penetration testing. This knowledge is essential for conducting professional security assessments and contributes directly to my development as a penetration tester capable of identifying and documenting security flaws in modern web applications.

# Skills Learned
Reconnaissance and Information Gathering
